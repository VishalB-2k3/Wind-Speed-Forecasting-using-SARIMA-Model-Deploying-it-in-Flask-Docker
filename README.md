# 🌪️ Wind Speed Forecasting using SARIMA Model 🚀  

This project, developed during an internship at **NIWE (National Institute of Wind Energy)**, focuses on forecasting wind speed using a **Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA)** model. The model is deployed as a **Flask web application** and containerized using **Docker** for seamless deployment.

## 📌 Project Overview  

1️⃣ **Data Processing**: Convert meteorological data from **NetCDF to CSV** using `xarray` and Python.  
2️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and perform feature engineering.  
3️⃣ **Model Development**: Train a **SARIMA model** using `statsmodels` to forecast wind speed.  
4️⃣ **Web Application**: Build a Flask app for user-friendly forecasting.  
5️⃣ **Dockerization**: Containerize the application for easy deployment across environments.
